        <h1>World Youth Skills Day 2020</h1>
        <i>15/07/2020</i>
        <p>
            As part of World Youth Skills Day (WYSD) 2020 I participated in a video with fellow graduates and apprentices from Babcock to discuss our experiences and opinions on challenges presented by COVID-19 for the young generations.

        <h3>Why is WYSD Important?</h3>
        <p>
            A 2015 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_413826.pdf">report written by S4YE</a> showed that 621 million young people aged 15-24 years old were not in education, employment or training and global youth unemployment is still on the <a href=“https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.ZS?”>rise</a>. 

            Over the past five years the UK rise in youth unemployment has not been as drastic as the global statistics, however, it is still on the rise and COVID-19 will have a significant impact. Between March and June 2020 there was a 116% increase in claims for unemployment related benefits. Whilst the government have put actions in place such as the furlough scheme and subsequent job retention scheme, there will undoubtably be a significant rise in unemployment this year. 
        
            This increase in unemployment will largely affect the the youth generation. <a href=“https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/young-workers-in-the-coronavirus-crisis/”>The Resolution Foundation estimate</a> that 1 in 3 18-24 year old employees (excluding students) have lost jobs or been furloughed compared to 1 in 6 prime-age adults. 
        
            During this global crisis, the United Nations General Assembly have created this day to raise awareness and to celebrate the successes of young people globally. 
        </p>

        <!-- ENABLING SKILLS FOR A RESILLIENT YOUTH (big fancy heading)-->

        <h3>What can we do to help?</h3>
        <p>
            Education and training are high on the UN's agenda. <a href=“http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/education-2030-incheon-framework-for-action-implementation-of-sdg4-2016-en_2.pdf”>The Incheon Declaration</a> aims to improve equality and access to education by 2030 and by doing so, promote lifelong learning for all.  Providing education to youth will help to provide resilience to situations such as that from COVID-19 where those who were most affected where those of a <a href=“https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/the-effects-of-the-coronavirus-crisis-on-workers/”>lower wage</a>. 

            Graduate schemes and apprenticeships, such as the one I am on with Babcock, also play a key role. The investment by these companies will enable young generations to gain the experience needed to build their careers. 

            By participating WYSD 2020 I am showing my support for the youth generations currently facing difficulties and highlighting the importance of education and investment in their futures.

                        The theme for this years International Women in Engineering Day (IWED) is 'Shape the World'. 
                        As part of IWED 2020 I was able to join a panel of young female engineers at Babcock where we discussed how our opportunities at Babcock have helped us Shape the World.

                        International Women in Engineering day was founded by the <a href="https://www.wes.org.uk/">Women's Engineering Society</a> and celebrates females in engineering. Their aims are to support women to reach their potential, promote education of engineering topics and raise awareness of gender diversity and equality in the workplace.
